			<h2>Who is Rogue Design Co.?</h2>
			<p><a href="http://rogin.xyz">Rogin Farrer</a>, the head honcho of RDC, has been making websites for over five years. He started building Wordpress blogs for himself as a hobby. He eventually got bored of generic themes, and started "hacking" them to suit his own tastes. Always up for a challenge, he then began making his own themes, and eventually his own sites, with and without Wordpress.</p>
			<p>In the web-centric world of 2016, it is increasingly important for career-minded inviduals and businesses to have a home on the web. They attract people to your business and provide a space to showcase your work. Because Rogue Design Co. is a small shop without complex office bureaucracy, we offer personalized attention and communication throughout the design and development process.</p>
			<p><strong>Our mission is to deliver modern, detail-oriented designs that emphasize speed, readability, and clarity, while providing individualized attention and service.</strong></p>
			<p>We work with individuals and businesses of all sizes. Though based in Boston, we can easily work and communicate with clients virtually anywhere. We always do our best to keep our work affordable.</p>
